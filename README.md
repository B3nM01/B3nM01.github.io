# Personal Grow Up Blog

Recenlty I've come to something that I've never though to. 
I never changed in my life, I've always been the same. I've tried to change and improve myself many times, but "FOCUS" periods where just...periods, and I've always come back to my normality. For this reason Im writing this, i guess, to document this project, which is, something I want to commit to and I hope will be the start for my grow up. 

The project is to pass GIAC Reverse Engineering Malware Certification, without taking SANS FOR610/710 courses which, well, they are not that affordable for me at the moment. So, I'll try to do it in 2 months, I would like to get the certification in January.
